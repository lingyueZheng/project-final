## Final Project: Portfolio
## Points: 55 points (40 = portfolio, 15 = presentation)

### Instructions

Develop a personal web site which reflects your professional pursuits.

The final portfolio may include works from other classes or professional experiences related to your field of study. This may include photography, published articles, video/audio segments, graphic design samples. For students outside the School of Communication, an alternative topic may be presented. Please discuss this with your professor before beginning work on the portfolio.

The idea is to have a web site which you can present to prospective employers for jobs and/or internships.

Your site must contain a **minimum of three (3) pages, but no more than eight (8).** It must be hosted online via GitHub and accessible via a domain name.

Your entire site must exhibit responsive design when accessible via a mobile device with a *maximum screen width of 320px.* Additionally, your résumé should be printable (You need a print style sheet *only* for your résumé.)

Site responsiveness will be tested in Google Chrome with the following settings:

- Device Model: iPhone 5
- Resolution: 320 x 568
- CSS Media: Screen

You have the freedom to be creative in how you present your portfolio, but the site must exhibit best web design practices throughout. This includes:

- Well-structured, valid HTML documents
- Effective presentation for web using CSS
- Proper site architecture
- Effective site navigation
- No design sins

That's it. Other than what are listed above there are no minimum requirements for use of specific HTML or CSS elements as were set forth in the previous two assignments. (For instance, if you include a résumé in your portfolio site, you do not need to include the in-page navigation for each section.)


### Deadline

The deadline for submission is based on the University of Miami final exam schedule. Projects are due prior to the start of their respective exam period, which is as follows:

- Section J (M,W 5-6:15p): Wednesday, April 29, 2015, 5-7:30 p.m.
- Section R (T,Th 2-3:15p): Tuesday, May 5, 2015, 2-4:30 p.m.
- Section T (T,Th 5-6:15p): Thursday, April 30, 2015, 5-7:30 p.m.

(Yes, this means some sections may have a little more time than others. Sorry. This is by luck of the draw.)

**[Create an issue](https://github.com/#/project-final/issues) in this repo with *your name* and a link to your *domain name* by the deadline. If you are unsure of how to submit, check the example provided in the Issues section.**


### Presentation

You are required to present your portfolio on the date of your final exam. Presentations should be about five (5) minutes in duration.

Topics you may choose to discuss:

- Is there a unique, interactive feature you incorporated into your design?
- Why did you choose specific design elements?
- What aspect of designing your web site did you find most challenging?

Be prepared for fellow students (or your professor) to ask questions.

**If links are not received by the start of the final class meeting, points allotted for the presentation of your portfolio will not be granted. Again, your presentation accounts for 15 points. Additionally, one (1) point will be deducted for every hour the assignment is late.**

During presentations, no laptops, mobile phones, devices, etc. will be permitted to be in use. Students are expected to be attentive and respectful of their peers. Those who are disruptive will be asked to leave and will forfeit their presentation points.


### Plagiarism

This should go without saying at this point, but we will repeat this so there is absolutely no confusion:

Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the University of Miami Honor Code. Academic dishonesty of any kind, for whatever reason, will not be tolerated. Plagiarism is the taking of someone else's words, work, or ideas, and passing them off as a product of your own efforts. Improper copying or reproduction of web site design and/or source code will also be considered an act of plagiarism.

**Plagiarism or lapses in web ethics, as detailed above and in the course syllabus, will result in a zero (0) on the assignment, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the University of Miami Honor Council**.


###Grading Rubric

So you can concentrate on presenting the best possible project, here is the criteria we will be checking:

Errors will result in a two-point (2) deduction.

- Is the site accessible via a domain name?
- Does the document validate using the W3C HTML Validator?
- Is the content structured with HTML5 tags?
- Are tags with purpose used where possible?
- Is there effective site navigation throughout the site?
- Do interactive elements respond as expected?
- Is CSS well-organized?
- Are images saved in a proper format, reasonable file size and image size?
- Are images, links working?
- Are special characters encoded?
- Does the text reflect correct style, spelling and grammar?
- Are files organized using proper site architecture?

Failure to execute the following will only result in a one-point (1) deduction.

- Is there a print style sheet for your résumé?
  - Does the design take best practices for print into account?
- Does the site render well in a 'mobile' setting?

Failure to attempt a mobile and/or print style sheet (résumé only) will result in a five-point (5) deduction. I understand these are trickier concepts and may not come out perfect. But there's really no excuse for not trying. (And no, simply copying and pasting your screen style sheet does not constitute 'trying'.)


## Javascript & jQuery

Many students who get into a groove designing their portfolios want to do something extra, like adding interactive effects that are often handled through Javascript, jQuery or jQuery plugins. Those concepts are beyond the scope of this course. However, I am not one to discourage anyone from taking the next step and learning something on your own to create the best possible web site you can create.

You *may* include Javascript on your web site. If you choose to add these interactive elements, **your site should not break.** It is a risk you take. So if you do try to add something Javascript-related and it does not work, always have a backup plan in place.

I will provide some resources for those interested in adding Javascript or jQuery. Implementation may require you to learn a little bit more outside of class and spend extra time reading documentation and prototyping. If you do have questions related to Javascript, I will only address those outside of class, during office hours, appointments or extra help sessions.

Students who opt to not include Javascript **will not** be penalized. I understand just focusing on HTML and CSS basics can be challenging enough for some students. That's okay. You can still create a great website without these interactive elements. So do not feel pressure if your peers are trying something you're not comfortable with -- focus on the fundamentals. :)


##Final Tips

Pay attention to detail.

**DO NOT** wait until the last minute.

Play. Explore. Have fun.

Do epic ... stuff. :)
